Phase_1: String Comparison

Realize the assembly code gave us a string in %eax. Then we realize phase one has a function that checks to see if two strings are equal. 
There is a jne that sends us to boom when we are returned a value of 1 from the strign comparison function. It logically follows that
a function that sees if two strings are equal would accept the string that was given to us in the code.
